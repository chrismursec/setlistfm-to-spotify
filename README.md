# SetlistFM To Spotify!

Welcome to SetlistFM to Spotify. This is a totally open sourced simple application that allows you to generate Spotfy playlists from a SetlistFM URL. The app itself is built with TypeScript and Express paired with plain old HTML.

Simply login with your Spotify credentials and then paste in your SetlistFM URL and a playlist name. From there, you can either generate the full playlist, or selected tracks from the setlist. And then the playlist will be ready in your spotify app!

Perfect if you've got a gig coming up and you want to learn the setlist beforehand.
